# React.Blog

Front End project to interact with my other Blog project running in `Go`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`updated`: I admit it have a lack of maintenance. I'll do it some day.

## Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode:

```cmd
yarn start
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

```cmd
yarn test
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder:

```cmd
yarn build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
